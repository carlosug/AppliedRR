This repository contains a collection of R tutorials, developed at the University of Maastricht for Global Studies that use R. 

The goal is to organize relevant material into modular components, for more efficient design and maintenance of material, that can be used across courses, and that are accessible to students during and after their studies.


## How to Use this Handbook

The handbook is written with Python 3.5, though other Python versions (including Python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.

The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly [IPython](http://ipython.org), [NumPy](http://numpy.org), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org), and related packages.

See [Index.ipynb](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/global-studies-methods/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.
