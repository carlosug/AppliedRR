This repository contains a collection of R tutorials, developed at the University of Maastricht for Applied Research that use R software. 

The goal is to organize relevant material into modular components, for more efficient design and maintenance of material, that can be used across courses, and that are accessible to students during and after their studies.


## Introduction

IDS aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with social science data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 8 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import  files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to inferential statistics. All lessons demonstrate how to work with databases directly from R.

## Learning outcomes

The curriculum for these students will be:

- Introduction to R
- Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis
- Create graphs for exploring your data
- Research Data Management
- Interpret Pearson correlation and scatter plots
- Loop functions in R
- Inferential Statistics
